# Hangfire Background Job with Serilog Integration

## Overview
This project demonstrates the integration of Hangfire for background job processing and Serilog for logging. The background job triggers the sending of messages and logs the process, while Serilog is configured to log the events both to the console and a file in JSON format.

### Key Features
- **Hangfire**: A library to handle background jobs, scheduled tasks, and recurring tasks.
- **Serilog**: A structured logging library that allows logs to be written to various outputs, including the console and files.

## Project Structure

- **Hangfire Integration**: The `StartbackGroundJobwithHangfire` method in the controller triggers a background job using Hangfire's `BackgroundJob.Enqueue` method. The job calls the `SendMessage` method that simulates sending a message and logs the operation.

- **Serilog Configuration**: The Serilog configuration is handled in the `AppExtension` static class, where logs are directed to the console and a JSON-formatted file named `appLogs.txt`.

## Code Explanation

### 1. Background Job Trigger

```csharp
[HttpGet(Name = "StartbackGroundJobwithHangfire")]
public IActionResult StartbackGroundJobwithHangfire()
{
    BackgroundJob.Enqueue(() => SendMessage("Eager to dive into the world of AI/ML but donâ€™t know where to begin?"));
    return Ok();
}
